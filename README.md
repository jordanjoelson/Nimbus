### GPT-Neo
Nimbus is powered by GPT-Neo, an open-source language model developed by EleutherAI. GPT-Neo is designed to generate human-like text based on the input it receives. Key features of GPT-Neo include:

- **Architecture**: Similar to GPT-2, but with enhancements such as local attention in every other layer.
- **Training Data**: Trained on the Pile dataset, a large-scale dataset designed for language modeling tasks.
- **Flexibility**: Being open-source, GPT-Neo allows developers to customize and fine-tune the model for specific applications.

**Key Specifications of GPT-Neo**:
- **Model Size**: Available in various sizes (e.g., 1.3 billion parameters).
- **Max Position Embeddings**: 2048 tokens.
- **Attention Mechanism**: Local attention with a window size of 256 tokens.

For more information on GPT-Neo, refer to the [Hugging Face documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs).

### Streamlit
Nimbus uses **Streamlit**, an open-source Python library, to create a user-friendly web application interface. Streamlit makes it easy to deploy Nimbus as a local app, allowing users to interact with the chatbot seamlessly in a web browser.
